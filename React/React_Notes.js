//why React ?
//React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
//It is maintained by Facebook and a community of individual developers and companies.
//React can be used as a base in the development of single-page or mobile applications.
//It is a declarative, efficient, and flexible JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
//It lets you compose complex UIs from small and isolated pieces of code called “components”.
//Virtual DOM: React creates an in-memory data structure cache, computes the resulting differences, and then updates the browser's displayed DOM efficiently.
//React allows developers to create large web applications that can change data, without reloading the page.
//The main purpose of React is to be fast, scalable, and simple.

// In vite Project =>
    // "JavaScript + SWC" refers to using JavaScript as the primary programming language while leveraging SWC (Speedy Web Compiler)
    // for tasks like transpilation and bundling.

// Key Points:
// JavaScript: The main language for writing your application's logic and components.
// SWC: A high-performance tool written in Rust, designed to:
// Transpile modern JavaScript (ES6+) to older versions (ES5) for broader browser compatibility.
// Bundle JavaScript files, though it’s less common for this purpose.
// Minify code to reduce file size.
// Transform code, such as converting JSX to JavaScript.
