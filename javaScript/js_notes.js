//Key Features of JS :
//1. JS is a lightweight, interpreted programming language. meaning that it doesn't need to be compiled before it is run. it's parsed at runtime.
//2. Event-driven programming language. This means that JS can execute code based on user actions like clicks and hovers.
//3. JS is a single-threaded language, meaning that it can only execute one task at a time. making it synchronous in nature.
//4. JS is a dynamically typed language. This means that we don't have to specify the data type of a variable when we declare it.
//5. JS is a prototype-based language. This means that objects can inherit properties directly from other objects.
//6. JS is a functional language. This means that functions are first-class citizens in JS. They can be passed around as arguments to other functions and can be returned from other functions.
//7. JS is a client-side language. This means that it runs on the client-side of the web, meaning that it runs in the browser.
//8. JS is a versatile language. It can be used for a variety of things, from building websites to building mobile apps to building server-side applications.


//Functional Programming VS Object-Oriented Programming
//A programming paradigm is a way of thinking about and structuring code. 
// There are two main paradigms in programming: functional programming and object-oriented programming.
//Functional Programming: focuses on constructing applications using pure functions. Code written this way is concise, predictable, and easy to test for unintended behavior.
//OOP: focuses on abstracting parts of an application into classes that define the attributes and behaviors. In OOP, our classes are like blueprints create object based instances.
